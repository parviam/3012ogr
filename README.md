# Optical Graph Recognition and Analysis (OGRA)

OGRA was a project created for MATH 3012: Applied Combinatorics under Dr. Yaofeng Su. As a proof-of-concept, it takes a simple photo of a graph, and determines its chromatic number, whether or not it is hamiltonian, and whether or not it forms an eulerian circuit.
